As they say, the journey of 1000 miles begins with one step, MpaMpe's footprints started last year when we teamed up at Women In FinTech Hacathon as young and enthusiast develpoers to tae part in last year's edition.
We drew ideas from allover the place, igniting our minds to thin of a FinTech olution that can be of social impact but also reduce both financial and digital divide with contributions to the wider 17 SDGs. We came up with the name MpaMpe, originating from one of our members of the past digital maretig experience that he had started out doing related but different setting.
Boom, MpaMpe was birthed! We were shortlisted among the 17 teams and were previledged to merge in top 5 and little did we now that it would spar a new journey with MpaMpe! This Hacathon is organised annually by HiPipo and last year was the second edition.
This year, around August, we participated in Google Developer Student's Challenge where we represented Uganda globally out out  800+ globally submitted solutions from different Universities. We were the only team selected from around 30 from Uganda, among four teams from all over Africa and yeah, we represented MU GDSC well.

At this point, you might be wondering what exactly is MpaMpe?
Well, MpaMpe locally means "Give us, we give out" in our context. We want to create a crowdfunding out of the box solution for Ugandans with clear accountability, transpency and unique. We do both support both crypto and fiat currencies and we believe MpaMpe will be at the forefront of fintech inclusion in Uganda and see societies transform. We are solving for about 7 goals from the 17 UN SDGs and our mandate is be a part of change that will see Uganda move to a middle income status in a few years to come.
We participated in this year's MTN MoMo Hacathon with only one hope of connecting, being mentored, networing, connecting and obviosly with a winning mentality. We are glad that we made it top 3 beiig first runners among an intense Hacathon full of great ideas and startups. 
We are a team of five and dominated by girls who are very tech enthusiats,ambitious and a great team at large. At MpaMpe, we believe it's God & Code! Yes, we put in efforts to see MpaMpe move to another level and we are actively and tirelessly developing and improvement MpaMpe!
